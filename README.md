==========================

What's this?
------------

This plugin is a [SPVM](https://github.com/yuki-kimoto/SPVM/) syntax plugin for Vim.

I tested this plugin on Vim 8.2, and it's maybe works on NeoVim. (but I'm not tested)

Installation
------------

This plugin could install by your favorite vim plugin manager.

For example:

Plug 'nyarla/vim-syntax-spvm'
```
